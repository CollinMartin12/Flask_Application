# Flask_Application
I developed a Flask application that utilizes a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) model to recommend exercises based on user preferences. The model analyzes a dataset of exercises, considering factors like exercise name, body part targeted, equipment used, and the exercise type (e.g., strength or cardio). By converting these features into a numerical representation, the TF-IDF model calculates the relevance of exercises in relation to the userâ€™s selected criteria. Users can input their desired body part, equipment, and exercise type, and the model generates personalized workout recommendations tailored to their specific needs. This interactive application enhances workout planning by offering relevant, data-driven exercise suggestions in real time. Below is a screen shot of the webpage
